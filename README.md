# Toucan

**Toucan** is an opinionated [Entity Component System](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq) framework for Roblox-TS that wraps over [Jecs](https://github.com/Ukendio/jecs) and [Planck](https://github.com/YetAnotherClown/planck), favoring developer experience over raw performance.

It was created as a way to remove the need of glueing together different ECS libraries and allowing the developer to start working on their actual game as soon as possible.

## Features

- **Fluent API:** abstracts away the concept of an ECS world in favor of a more concise way of manipulating entities, queries and other things[^1];

- **Hooks:** provides built-in topologically aware functions, such as `useDeltaTime` and `useThrottledMemo`;

- **Plugins:** enables better organization of components and systems by grouping them together, which in turn also allows for third-party plugins that are easy to integrate;

- **Phases:** inherited from Planck, systems are assigned to predefined phases[^2] in order to resolve dependencies between them;

- **Everything is an entity:** inherited from Jecs, components, resources and relationships are also entities, allowing you to assign them metadata and inspect them.

[^1]: This does come with the cost of a relatively lower performance (~20-40% less than Jecs; actual benchmarks will be done and documented when things get more stable).

[^2]: Having predefined phases is what allows for third-party plugins that are easy to integrate.

## Example

```ts
import { App, component, entity, pair, Plugin, query, STARTUP, Wildcard } from '@rbxts/toucan'

const Likes = component()

const bob = entity('Bob')
const charlie = entity('Charlie')
const alice = entity('Alice')
    .set(pair(Likes, bob))
    .set(pair(Likes, charlie))

function greetInterests(greeting: string) {
	query(pair(Likes, Wildcard)).forEach((subject) => {
		subject.targetsOf(Likes).forEach((interest) => {
			print(greeting.format(interest.label(), subject.label()))
		})
	})
}

class GreetingPlugin implements Plugin {
	constructor(public readonly greeting: string) {}

	build(app: App) {
		app.addSystems(STARTUP, [greetInterests], this.greeting)
	}
}

new App().addPlugins(new GreetingPlugin("Hey %s, nice to meet you! I'm %s.")).run()
```

# Testing Workflow

Given `toucan` and a test game `toucan-test`, in order to automatically send changes over, you must first follow the steps below a single time only:

+ On `toucan`, run `npm run build`, then `yalc publish`
+ On `toucan-test`, run `yalc add @rbxts/toucan`, then `npm install`

Then, in order to start testing `toucan` on `toucan-test`, run `npm run watch` on `toucan`.

## Fallback

In case `yalc` fails, the script `packInstall` works as a fallback, packaging `toucan` and installing it on `toucan-test`. Just remember to update it to reference the right test game.
